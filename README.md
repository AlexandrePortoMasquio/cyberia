Cyberia Protocol

Cyberia is a decentralized protocol for peer-to-peer generative AI prompts.Built on Solana for speed and minimal transaction cost, Cyberia is designed as an informational infrastructure where prompts are executed, tokenized, and routed in a trustless, public, and programmable network.

🚀 Crypto-informational infrastructure
🧠 Decentralized AI execution and prompt economy
⚡ Optimized for low fees and high performance
🌐 Web3, Post-IP, anti-censorship

📐 Architecture

Language: Rust

Framework: Anchor

Blockchain: Solana

Program directory: /programs/cyberia_program

The current state includes the foundational logic for a prompt-based decentralized compute protocol.The MVP will act as a minimal, testable peer-to-peer prompt router using Cyberia's native token (XCYB) for transactions, deployed on Solana.

🛠️ Build
